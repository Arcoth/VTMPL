Variadic Template Meta Programming Library

This is a template meta programming library which uses the variadic template feature introduced into C++ with the latest official C++ standard, ISO C++11.

It makes uses of variadic templates to ease the definition of various compile-time mechanisms and is powerful yet lightweight. Some headers can be used on their own; they just depend on some definitions in typedefs.hxx.
